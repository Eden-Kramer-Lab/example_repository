### How to add a repository to the Github Organization

If your repositories already exists under your personal Github account, you can transfer it to the [Eden-Kramer-Lab Github organization](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab) by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account/#transferring-to-an-organization).

Otherwise, you can go to the [Eden-Kramer-Lab Github organization](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab) page, create a new repository there, and [upload your files](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).
